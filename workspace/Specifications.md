from any point and time. That's right! We can show you star patterns from past, present and future!

Please tell us which of these cities you live nearest to.
(city1, city2, city3, city4, city5, city6, city7, city8, city9, city10...) :
Okay, great! 
Now, please enter the time, month date and year in which you'd like to see the constellations (0:00, January 12, 2019) :

___Anticipated Challenges___ 
    Some of the anticipated challenges include finding and displaying the exact position in the sky.  We intend to meet this challenge
    by attempting the creation of a three dimensional array of the night sky.  Another challenge includes the amount of research and
    ensuring the rotation of the earth is correct.  The solution to this is to make sure the research we do is accurate and correct.
