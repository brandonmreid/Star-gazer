Prefice: We haven't mapped every constellation which means according to our code 
there will be points and times where there will be no constellations.  
Project 3 things:
Libraries:
- locations 
- - Coordinate 
- - major cities (6 max per country)
- Constellations 
- Information on constellations (last thing to put in)

Goals
- see what constellation will be overhead at a given place and time

Stages of user input
1.) where in earth orbit (time)
2.) location earth
3.) compute constellations based on that information
4.) print to an array
5.) print to a file (if user wants)

Who does what (tentative):
- orbital models (visual aid) (Elizabeth)
- Pass user input to algorithm (Brandon and Moses)
- User interface (Elon)
- Algorithm (Eric)
